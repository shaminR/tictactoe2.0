Tic Tac Toe 2.0

This is a graphical tic tac toe game written using HTML and JavaScript. First choose either X or O to go first, then press on a vacant tile to place it. X and O automatically alternate after the first placement. Once 3 in a row are detected, the winner is declared. The Reset Button vacates all tiles and clears the winner.
